# Introduction to Linux for Mechatronics
### Why Linux Matters in Mechatronics?

---

## What is Linux?
- An open-source operating system kernel.  
- Powers a wide range of devices, including embedded systems, embedded control systems, robotics, agritech, automotive, and mobile phones.  
- Provides stability, security, and flexibility for automation and robotics applications.

## Why Use Linux in Mechatronics?
- Real-time control capabilities with custom kernels.  
- High performance for resource-constrained systems.  
- Wide range of tools for simulation, testing, and deployment.  
- Community-driven support for frameworks like ROS (Robot Operating System) and embedded control systems.

---

### Example Scenario
- A robotic arm controlled by a Linux-based system.  
- Use ROS on Linux for motion planning and sensor integration.  
- Simulate the arm in Gazebo before real-world deployment.  
- Implement embedded control systems for precision tasks in an agritech automation solution.

# Getting Started with Linux Basics
### Essential Commands for Beginners

---

## Basic Linux Commands

### File Operations

#### Creating a File:
```bash
touch example.txt
```

#### Listing Files:
```bash
ls -l
```

#### Viewing File Content:
```bash
cat example.txt
```

#### Deleting a File:
```bash
rm example.txt
```

---

### Directory Operations

#### Creating a Directory:
```bash
mkdir myfolder
```

#### Changing Directory:
```bash
cd myfolder
```

#### Removing a Directory:
```bash
rmdir myfolder
```

---

### Exploring the File System

#### Viewing Current Directory:
```bash
pwd
```

#### Navigating to the Parent Directory:
```bash
cd ..
```

#### Finding Files:
```bash
find /path -name "filename"
```

---

### Process Management

#### Viewing Running Processes:
```bash
top
```

#### Killing a Process by PID:
```bash
kill <PID>
```

### Explanation:
- `top`: Displays real-time system resource usage.
- `kill`: Terminates a process by its Process ID.

---

### User Management Basics

#### Adding a New User:
```bash
sudo adduser newuser
```

#### Switching Users:
```bash
su - newuser
```

#### Deleting a User:
```bash
sudo deluser newuser
```
